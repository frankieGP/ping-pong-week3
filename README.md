1. Create a function in front-end that will output the same value as the user input.
  Input: 4
  Output: 4
2. Create a looping function to output the input string starting at 1 and stopping when the inputted interger is arrived at.
  Input: 4
  Output 1 2 3 4
3. Create an if statement to replace 3  with the word "ping".
  Input: 4
  Output: 1 2 ping 4
4. Create an if statement to check if a number is divisible by 3. If true then replace that number with "ping".
  Input: 7
  Output: 1 2 ping 4 5 ping 7
5. Create an if state to replace 5 with the word "pong".
  Input: 10
  Output: 1 2 ping 4 pong ping 7 8 ping 10
6. Create an if statement to check if a number is divisible by 5. If true then replace that number with "pong".
  Input: 11
  Output: 1 2 ping 4 pong ping 7 8 ping pong 11
7. Append the character "-" if a number is divisible by 15 to connect the ping and pong from being divisible by both 3 and 5.
